# ATM Project


## Project Description

<p> A simple ATM designed to allow user to withdraw and input cash, which updates overall balance. My modifications were to style. I also added an alert when an invalid number was input for deposit and when a user tries to get more funds out then is in their account. This is a REACT based project that was assigned via MIT xPROs Full Stack Developer Professional Certification.  </p>
